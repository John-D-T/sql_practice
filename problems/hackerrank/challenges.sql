-- okay so we want hacker_id, name, and total number of challenges they've created

-- sort by total number of challenges - desc, THEN hacker_id

-- filter out rows which share the total number of challenges AND have a count less than the max number of challenges

-- look to create 3 columns:
    -- count() - total no of challenges
    -- count() of the count() - might need a group by for this
    -- max()
